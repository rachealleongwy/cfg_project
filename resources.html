    <h2>Why learn to code?</h2>
		<br>
    <p>Programming jobs overall are growing 12% faster than the market average as companies in the tech sector race to
			innovate and improve operational efficiency. There are equally as many openings in industries outside of technology
			such as finance, manufacturing and healthcare.</p>
			<p>Coding skills are in high demand, yet statistics show that girls are being left behind.
			Gender differences in STEM education participation at the expense of girls are visible in higher education,
			where women represent only 35% of all students enrolled in STEM fields, especially ICT. In reality, coding is
			the language of the future and it should equally accessible to anyone with the desire to learn, regardless of gender or background.</p>
